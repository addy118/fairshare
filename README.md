# 💸 FairShare – Expense Splitting Reimagined

**Not your ordinary expense splitter.**  
FairShare goes beyond just dividing the bill equally — it handles real-world scenarios like **partial payments by 2 out of 8 members**, supports **custom ratios like 1:4**, and intelligently **minimizes total transactions** using a graph algorithm.

Whether you're **roommates sharing rent and utilities**, **friends on a vacation**, or **tired of tracking money in spreadsheets or WhatsApp chats**, FairShare makes your group expenses **fair, optimized, and frictionless**.


## 🔑 Features

- ✅ **Secure Two-Way Payments**  
  Every transaction requires mutual agreement for added trust.

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Social Connections**  
  Create groups, and transact only within your trusted network.

- 📐 **Flexible Split Options**  
  Equal or unequal, single or multiple payers — you decide the rules while logging.

- 🔁 **Recurring Expenses & Debt Tracking**  
  Auto-track shared subscriptions or bills with visual summaries.

- 📧 **Bill Email Reminders**  
  Stay notified and never miss a payment.

- 📄 **PDF Export for Reports**  
  Generate clean, shareable reports in one click.


## 🧠 Smart Split Algorithm

Our **graph algorithm** minimizes the number of transactions required to settle debts within a group.

- 🔄 Minimizes total transaction count
- 🌍 Supports multi-currency optimization
- 👥 Handles complex group scenarios effortlessly


## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Create a Group & Invite Members**  
   Set up your group, add members, and get started in seconds.

2. **Add & Track Expenses in Real Time**
   - Log the expense name and total amount
   - Log all the participants in a payment, all the payers with their amount
   - Everyone stays updated with the transactions.

3. **Simplify Settlements with Smart Splits**  
   FairShare’s algorithm calculates the most efficient way to settle up.

4. **Two-way payment confirmation**
   Payment is marked as done in the group for all only after both the end users acknowledge it.
